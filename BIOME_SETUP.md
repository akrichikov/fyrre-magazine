# Biome Setup Complete âœ…

## What was fixed:

1. **Installed Biome**: Added `@biomejs/biome` v1.9.4 to devDependencies
2. **Created VS Code Settings**: Added `.vscode/settings.json` with proper Biome configuration
3. **Initialized Biome Config**: Created `biome.json` with Next.js-optimized settings
4. **Added NPM Scripts**: Added convenient scripts for formatting and linting
5. **Cleared Caches**: Removed old Biome cache and extension data

## Configuration Details:

### VS Code Settings (`.vscode/settings.json`):
- Disabled PATH search to use local installation
- Set Biome as default formatter for JS/TS/JSON files
- Enabled format on save and code actions

### Biome Config (`biome.json`):
- Enabled Git integration and ignore files
- Configured for 2-space indentation (React/Next.js standard)
- Added proper file ignores (.next, node_modules, etc.)
- Enabled recommended linting rules
- Set up TypeScript import type checking

## Available Commands:

```bash
npm run format      # Format all files
npm run lint:biome  # Lint all files  
npm run check       # Format, lint, and organize imports
```

## Next Steps:

1. **Restart Cursor/VS Code** to pick up the new configuration
2. **Install Biome Extension** if not already installed
3. **Test formatting** by opening a file and saving it
4. **Run checks** using the npm scripts above

## Troubleshooting:

If you still see the "Could not resolve Biome" error:
1. Restart Cursor completely
2. Run `npm run check` to verify CLI works
3. Check that the Biome extension is enabled
4. Verify `.vscode/settings.json` exists and has correct paths

The error you were seeing should now be resolved! ðŸŽ‰
